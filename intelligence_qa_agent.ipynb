The two main options are: the forfaitaire regime (most common), which applies a flat tax of 6.5% (6% tax + 0.5% CRDS) on the full sale price if it exceeds €5,000, regardless of any actual gain or loss; or the irrevocable real regime (elected via form no. 2092 within one month of the sale), where the capital gain (sale price minus acquisition price or market value declared at succession) is taxed at 19% income tax plus 17.2% social levies for a total of 36.2%, with a holding period abatement of 5% per year beyond the second year leading to full exemption after 22 years.
